ABOUT "Dream & Design":

The project we are working on is a system which will provide house owners with 
interior designers & decorators. Through this system we want to make it easier 
for house owners to find a perfect decorator and designer for their house. In our 
system designers and decorators will be able to advertise their existing projects 
and the projects theyâ€™re willing to work on. Based on those advertisement 
customers will be able to decide which decorator or designer is best suited for 
them.
